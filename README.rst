pulseaudio-streamer
===================

Detects UPnP media renderers to stream audio to

About
-----

A small python application that scans the network for UPnP device. It
creates a pulseaudio null sink for each. This allows you select it as an
output devices for each application in puvucontrol. When a sink becomes
active the monitor for it gets encoded and streamed over the network to
the UPnP device.

The functionality of this is a copy of `pulseaudio-dlna`_. The reason I
decided to recreate it was because of a number bugs I had experienced
when using pulseaudio-dlna with `gmediarender-reserect`_ which I have
running on raspberry pi.

This is a effort to have a seemless experience streaming to
gmediarender. At current it is in very early development and just about
works. It is lacking many features and I cannot say it will support many
devices.

The reason I didn’t focus my time in trying to improve pulseaudio-dlna
was because I did not know how the UPnP protocol works and thrus decided
to build my own so I could learn. I may at some point go back and debug
pulseaudio-dlna now know how the things work.

Usage
-----

Clone the repo and run the below in your shell:

.. code:: shell

    python2 ./main.py

If your lucky devices will show in pavucontrol and you will get a
dropdown against each application to select which device you stream to.
